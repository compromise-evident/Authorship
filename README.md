# How it works

<p align="center">

</p>

You can't prove that you created your content, or that
it's not fake or false. But you can prove it's coming
from you--not impersonation. And you're NEVER locked-in
to any type of encryption;
Data is authenticated using the binary
presence & absence of keys to lists of encrypted
items (hence publicly verifiable yet authorized-only.)
These encrypted items hide no substance of value,
their only purpose is to pose a difficulty.

### The wrong way

Let's say you published a list of encrypted items
then became a target for exposing war crimes.
Each time I ask for proof of life, you publish
one key, until you're out of keys.
You'll need to publish new lists.
But because you're a target,
I have to assume new encrypted
items under your name are impersonation.
How would you have forced that original list to represent
a NEW list that's not pregenerated to finiteness?
Authorship does just that;

### The right way

When I ask for proof of life, instead of releasing one key,
make a new list of encrypted items then selectively release half the keys to that original list, all at once.
Now, as I look at your original list of encrypted items,
I cross out any that I can decrypt.
When I take a step back,
a binary message appears; what's crossed out and left uncrossed
represents ones and zeros not predetermined.
<ins>This message can be anything at any time, even though it comes from something old and immutable.</ins>
And so you make this message represent personal thoughts for this event,
along with the hash of that new list
(so as to build an authorized-only relationship with that new list.)

# For

*   **Exposure is allowed**
    (typically authentication--rolling-code or not--relies
    on shared secrets; employers allow you to
    open doors only if that door accepts your
    private string of characters--matching what the
    door expects to see; The door is aware of a secret
    and must never expose it. But if instead the door
    contained your Authorship number, that ever-changing number
    can be displayed on the door and even made public.
    EVERYTHING you gave the door, and EVERYTHING the
    door contains, can be safely made public raw.)
*   **Compromise-evident device**
    (just as tamper-evident devices prove they've
    been tampered with, Authorship proves its user
    has been compromised; Your adversary's goal is
    to take your life and continue modifying
    your Authorship number--fooling us into thinking you're
    still there. But if your personal folder
    was protected, no one can modify on your behalf.
    This is how we'll know not to
    trust words under your name
    unless we can verify your
    number modification. In fact, compromise-evident is my tag because Authorship is my centerpiece and my masterpiece.)
*   **Canary update authentication**
*   **Group authorization**
    (Authorship numbers can be assembled using ciphertext from multiple users.)
*   **Animal theft management**
    (animal biometric data can be assigned to Authorship numbers in a ledger; If you can't modify the
    number associated with your animal, it's not your animal. Authority registrars should be able to
    easily identify animals such as by imaging a cow's wrinkly nose.)
*   **Voter fraud prevention**
    (you verify voters whom only registrars identify.)
*   **Ownership proof**
    (assign item to Authorship number, modify it with their message to prove ownership.)
*   **Cryptographer's acknowledgement**
    (you may need to verify that your new Authorship number
    is available to the public or verifying party--as you can be censored in some
    extreme circumstances. Here, the verifying party may arrange to modify their
    number in response and you can rest assured that your authentication
    event has been acknowledged.)
*   **Skipping through verification with outdated numbers**
    (here, the proving
    party had published multiple Authorship numbers beforehand. Their main number had changed
    so many times, public files older than a year for example, have been discarded.
    Now, those who have not verified since the number publishing, wish to know that
    each and every modification to this date is what the proving party intended.
    And so the proving party is asked to modify one of their slower numbers of
    higher viscosity. The message for that event instructs all verifying parties
    to overwrite the main number with a new one. Now those catching up have access
    to periodic verification as if they ran through the entire chain.)
*   **Disposable sessions without breaking trust**
    (let's say some service had
    published a single Authorship number beforehand, and serves one million users on their
    network years later. Each user requested in simultaneity and demanded
    authentication for each and every byte. Here, the service's number is not
    modified per user since that would require all users to catch up on verification
    as they wait their turn with the service. Instead, the service modifies its main
    number once with a message containing the sha256sum of a text file of specified
    size uploaded separately. This text file contains one million new
    numbers--each disposable and dedicated to one user. Meanwhile, the service's
    new main number awaits future visitors who were forced to verify only once so far.
    Those without access to the public file for this main event may ask the service
    to modify a slower number--as done in the previous point.)

# Why

Julian Assange and Edward Snowden used cryptographic evidence
systems generally too complex and inaccessible, which led many to uncertainty
in a time of great public distrust for government.
This inspired me to search for, discover (Dec 2019), and build Authorship--logical
authentication anyone can understand in 15 seconds.
