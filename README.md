## Your lock, your words!

Authorship is computational difficulty and super-flexibility in endless
cryptographic evidence (publicly-verifiable authorized-only number modification.)
You can generate and publish a personal Authorship number, preferably before you
are subject to censorship or worse. This way the public can trust its ownership.
Once you become a governmental threat, the public inquires about your well being
after which--you modify your number. Given that only you can modify your number,
and given that the public or verifying party is here-given the ability to verify
your modification,  we can rest assured that any further correspondence from you
is not impersonation. Additionally you can insert data, messages, links, or hash
for every authentication event meaning information source can be trusted. Uses:

 * Proof of life.
 * User authentication.
 * Canary update authentication.
 * Data, author, and version control authentication.
 * Unretentive suspend-able untraceable anonymous cryptocurrency
   (publicly-verifiable authorized-only withdrawal/ownership hand-over.)
 * Untraceable anonymous fair trade over any network
   (cryptographic solution to the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma.)
 * Group and military authorization.
 * Animal theft management.
 * Voter fraud prevention.
