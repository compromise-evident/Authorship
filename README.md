# Uses & features

 1. **Proof of life**
 2. **User authentication**
 3. **Canary update authentication**
 4. **Data, authorship, and version control authentication**
    (your 9k-character message is also authorized-only.)
 5. **Unretentive suspend-able untraceable anonymous cryptocurrency**
    (traceable fungible withdrawal -OR- untraceable non-fungible hand-over.
    Ownership handover means some anonymous recipient generates a number,
    and the sender modifies his own with a message containing that recipient's
    number. Verifying parties overwrite the sender's number in their ledger
    with the new number in the sender's message. The item assigned to the
    sender's number is now assigned to the recipient's number. Who the item
    came from and to whom it now belongs remains unknown.)
 6. **Untraceable anonymous fair trade over any network**
    (cryptographic solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Feature 5: it is already
    possible to simply hand numbers over. The only problem would be whether or
    not--amid sharing over some network--the other party had honestly handed
    their number over to you. The solution is not dependent on the chance of
    equal cooperation. No matter who uploaded first or held more number
    fragments at any point in time, trade is always either fair or nonexistent.
    And there is never loss on either end. Essentially, numbers are given backup
    paths just before the trade. Fair trade devalues the backups while defection
    devalues the trade: 2 anonymous users include each other's numbers in their
    message, asking to trade with that number. If verifying parties see that both
    user messages coincide, both NEW numbers are simply swapped. Otherwise nothing
    happens with each except for 2 wasted modifications.)
 7. **Group and military authorization**
    (numbers can be assembled using functions from multiple users.)
 8. **Animal theft management**
    (assign animal ID to Authorship number, registrars should easily identify
    animals such as by imaging a cow's wrinkly nose.)
 9. **Voter fraud prevention**
    (you verify voters whom only registrars identify.)
 10. **Ownership proof**
    (assign item to Authorship number, modify with their message to prove ownership.)
 11. **Rolling-code replacement**
    (use extended cryptographer's acknowledgment, see feature 14.)
 12. **Verify encrypted transactions without decrypting**
    (feature 5: "untraceable anonymous" is the transaction encryption. If
    transactions are both untraceable and anonymous, they are essentially
    encrypted, exposing only enough leverage to be verified thanks to the way
    Authorship works. Other crypto have traces which merely come close to useless.
    Authorship handover traces are 100% useless--perfect untraceability.)
 13. **Adjustable compromise-evident device**
    (just as tamper-evident devices prove they've been tampered with,
    Authorship proves its user has been compromised, and no one can impersonate
    that user--feature 4. This can be a dead-man's switch and early warning for
    groups. "Self-destruct if no timely mouse movement" is an inactivity-evident
    device adjustable to match the time it takes to modify your number and upload
    the public file where inactivity results in nothing uploaded--cryptographically-killed
    authentication events. Access to your ever-changing Authorship private file means
    your adversary can impersonate you publicly. Their goal is to interrupt your life,
    without interrupting your authentication events. Authorship forces them to operate
    with unlikely delicacy... You can message that you're alive, but when compromised,
    those with access to your device can keep messaging on your behalf and fool the public.
    With Authorship, they would need access to your Authorship private file
    in order to make those messages publicly-verifiable.)
 14. **Exposure-independent authentication**
    (typically, authentication--rolling-code or not--relies on shared secrets;
    employers allow you to open a door if and only if that door accepts your ID
    or secret string of characters--matching what the door already expects to see.
    The door is aware of a secret and must never expose it. But if instead the door
    contained your Authorship number which only you modify, that ever-changing number
    can be displayed on the door and even made public. EVERYTHING you gave the door,
    and EVERYTHING the door contains, can be safely made public raw.
    And thanks to super-flexibility of Authorship, those things can be
    safely made public raw, forever.)
 15. **Symmetry-independent authentication**
    (feature 14; verifying parties are not and need not be aware of what any
    Authorship number should look like after modification. In fact, no one knows;
    numbers are not predetermined but generated upon modification. They can be any string,
    but preferably that which Authorship gives you. The essence of Authorship is what
    emerges from the presence and absence of keys. Verifying parties simply check that
    modification makes sense mathematically. They are given every function but not
    every key; modifying parties indefinitely withhold all-new secrets for each event.
    And thanks to super-flexibility of Authorship, those secrets can increase
    in size and quantity forever.)

 16. **Encryption-type-independent authentication**
    (feature 15; the essence of Authorship is a clever assembly of encrypted items.
    Those items can be anything of difficulty, including riddles, encrypted files,
    and even philosophical puzzles. A deeper essence of Authorship is what emerges
    when solutions are withheld, selectively. No matter the encrypted item type,
    it stands alone to serve as something solved or unsolved (2 actions.)
    Authorship does not depend on item particularities in order to assemble those items.)

 17. **Physical difficulty-type-independent authentication**
    (feature 16; the core of Authorship is that keys being withheld is information.
    Keys can also be solutions to (or proof of compromise for) anything physical,
    while a similar hash and message system can be used to describe the next set
    of physical difficulties, their location, and other attributes.)
* **Cryptographer's acknowledgement** - you may need to verify that your new number
    is available to the public or verifying party--as you can be censored in some
    extreme circumstances. Here, the verifying party may arrange to modify their
    number in response and you can rest assured that your authentication
    event has been acknowledged.
* **Skipping through verification with outdated numbers** - here, the proving
    party had published multiple numbers beforehand. Their main number had changed
    so many times, public files older than a year for example, have been discarded.
    Now, those who have not verified since the number publishing, wish to know that
    each and every modification to this date is what the proving party intended.
    And so the proving party is asked to modify one of their slower numbers of
    higher viscosity. The message for that event instructs all verifying parties
    to overwrite the main number with a new one. Now those catching up have access
    to periodic verification as if they ran through the entire chain.
* **Disposable sessions without breaking trust** - let's say some service had
    published a single number beforehand, and serves one million users on their
    network years later. Each user requested in simultaneity and demanded
    authentication for each and every byte. Here, the service's number is not
    modified per user since that would require all users to catch up on verification
    as they wait their turn with the service. Instead, the service modifies its main
    number once with a message containing the sha256sum of a text file of specified
    size uploaded separately. This text file contains one million new
    numbers--each disposable and dedicated to one user. Meanwhile, the service's
    new main number awaits future visitors who were forced to verify only once so far.
    Those without access to the public file for this main event may ask the service
    to modify a slower number--as done in the previous point.
