Note on contracts



Previous versions had 3 more options: Govern, Secure, Settle.

In previous versions, multiple users/oracles generate
ciphertext then combine them as a list where everyone
agreed that the hash (number) of that list is the same.

This way, each oracle has certainty that their
ciphertext had indeed been included in that list.

...So that when it's time to judge a circumstance
and authorize a transaction based on that judgment,
satisfied oracles share their keys while unsatisfied
oracles withhold their keys--stalling the transaction.



In version 7.0.0, if you ensure that numbers are always
an average honest hash, you may for example, have two
oracles generate half the required ciphertext for a list.
Increase number of oracles through higher list partition.
