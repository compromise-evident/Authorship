Authorship summary



Create - generates a list of 512 encrypted items.
         Its sha512sum hash is your Authorship
         number. Share this number publicly.

Modify - generates your new number.
         Creates a disposable .public file
         containing all 512 PREVIOUS encrypted
         items, and 256 keys to those items,
         where key presence and absence
         represents a bit-balanced sha512sum hash
         of your NEW number and 9k-char message,
         which are included in that .public file.
         Publish that disposable .public file.

         (Bit-balanced hash means the string
         that is your NEW # & message is appended
         to, until its hash contains 256 0 bits
         and 256 1 bits--averaging to ~15 zeros
         appended as seen in .public file ends.)

Verify - those with your first number receive
         that .public file. They hash the
         encrypted items. This hash must be
         equal to your first number.

         Those with your first number then test
         the included 256 keys against the 512
         encrypted items--decrypting only 256.

         This binary order of "decrypted, no key"
         represents a bit-balanced sha512sum hash
         of your NEW number and 9k-char message,
         (which are present in that .public file.)

         Those with your first number then hash
         the string that is your NEW number and
         9k-char message. This hash must be equal
         to the one represented in binary through
         the presence and absence of keys.

         Those with your first number then
         overwrite your first number with
         your NEW number, and read your
         message if included.
