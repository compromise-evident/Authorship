Create - makes a list of 512 encrypted items.
         Its sha512sum hash is your number.
         
Modify - creates your new number.
         Your old number is then
         forced to describe it;
         
         Creates public file with
         previous encrypted items
         as described by old number.
         
         Only half their keys are
         included. Key "presence
         and absence" represents
         your new number & message.



Public file is 6 lines of text:
1. 512 ciphertext  (1,000 char each; 33 to 126.)
2. 256 keys        (1,000 digits each.)
3. 512 indicators  (1 bit each, tells which ciphertext to decrypt.)
4. Their message   (Authenticated; sha512sum hash of last 3 lines is actually what's represented by key presence & absence.)
5. Their new #     (Authenticated; sha512sum hash of last 3 lines is actually what's represented by key presence & absence.)
6. ~15 zeros

Zeros in line 6 make the last 3
lines produce a sha512sum hash
with 256 0 bits and 256 1 bits.

Hence strictly 256 keys are used.
Otherwise if you could use arbitrarily
many keys, attackers could interject the
publishing of your public file and withhold
whichever keys allows "presence and absence"
to represent their strings and not your own.)
